    <h4>Conference Format</h4>

    <p class="text-justify">
    The 2021 conference will be a <i>virtual</i> conference, entirely online.

    The daily schedule will involve five days of parallel sessions, with around
    four hours of talks.  More details can be found below and on
    the <a href="{{info.programlink}}">program</a> page.
    </p>

    <p>
    A <a href="student.html#details">student paper competition</a> is open to
    current and recent students attending the conference.  In addition, a
    <a href="about.html#specialissue">special issue</a> devoted to the themes of
    the conference is open to all.
    </p>

    <p>
    The following tutorials will be offered this year.
    <ul class=>
      <li>Multigrid - the Fundamentals (Luke Olson, Wed Mar 24)</li>
      <li>Algebraic Multigrid and Advanced Topics (James Brannick and Karsten
      Kahl, Thu Mar 25)</li>
      <li>Parallel Multigrid (Ulrike Yang, Fri Mar 26)</li>
    </ul>
    Each tutorial will be 2 hours long from 16:00 - 18:00 UTC (9am - 11am PDT,
    12pm - 2pm EDT, 17:00 - 19:00 CET)
    </p>

    <h4 id="specialissue">Journal Special Section on Multigrid Methods</h4>

    <p>
     As in previous odd-numbered years, a special section focused on recent advances in multigrid
     is planned for publication in the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing.
     Submissions are encouraged in all
     aspects of multigrid methods, including this year's highlighted <a href="about.html#topics">topics</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
     Attendees and participants of the conference as well as the general
     community are invited to submit papers.  The papers should meet the
     formatting and editorial requirements of SIAM Journal on Scientific
     Computing.  Special section page limit policy: SIAM Journal on Scientific
     Computing has a page limit policy of approximately 20 journal pages. This
     limit can be exceeded if the referees and editor are convinced that a
     longer paper is required; however, due to total size restrictions, papers
     longer than 25 pages will not be considered for publication in the
     special section.
    </p>

    <p>

    Submissions for the special issue will be accepted from
    {{deadlines.specialissueopen.date }} until
    <b>{{deadlines.specialissue.date}}</b>.  Papers will be subject to review
    by a guest Editorial Board.  Submissions should be made using the ordinary
    submission process at <a href="http://sisc.siam.org">
    http://sisc.siam.org</a>.  with a statement in the cover letter requesting
  that the paper be considered for the special issue.  In addition, the "Copper
  Mountain Special Section 2021" should be selected in the Special Section
  dropdown.
