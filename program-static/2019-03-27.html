The so-called magnetoquasistatic approximation or eddy current problem is a standard approach to simulate the behavior of electrical machines. Thereby Maxwell's equations are simplified by neglecting the displacement current density in Ampère's circuit law. The resulting time-dependent eddy current problem is typically solved by a time-stepping approach, which sequentially solves one time step after the other. For long time periods, as for example at the startup of an electrical machine, the time-stepping approach leads to high computational costs. In contrast, parallel-in-time methods enable parallelism by computing multiple time steps simultaneously and, therefore, are promising techniques for reducing the simulation time of this long range time-dependent problems.</p>
<p>We apply two parallel-in-time algorithms (Parareal and Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT)) to the eddy current problem of a two-dimensional coaxial cable model problem and compare the runtime results of the time-parallel solutions to the runtime of the time-stepping approach.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:25</td><td><a name="talk:90661"><div class="authors"><a href="person58.html" class="person">Eric C.

Cyr</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Transient PDE constrained optimization is challenging due to repeated forward and backward simulation. Using current approaches, when a simulation uses only a parallel spatial decomposition near the strong scaling limit, the time to solution for the optimization problem cannot be decreased by adding more computational resources. Addressing this issue requires algorithmic advancement in optimization algorithms and solution methods. This talk proposes a parallel-in-time multigrid preconditioner for solving transient KKT systems arising in an inexact SQP algorithm. Our composite-step SQP algorithm utilizes inexact iterative solution of "benign" KKT systems, corresponding to a sequence of strictly convex quadratic programs. Its inexactness-handling mechanisms ensure global and fast local convergence. The preconditioner used to solve the KKT system is critical to the efficiency of this algorithm. Our preconditioner explicitly exposes continuity in time constraints using a time domain decomposition technique. These constraints are relaxed and the coupled forward-adjoint system is solved using a Krylov method preconditioned with a multigrid in time algorithm. This talk will present the preconditioner and show results indicating convergence the scalability of the approach. Results demonstrating speedups assuming spatial parallelism is saturated for two dimensional nonlinear PDEs will be presented.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:50</td><td><a name="talk:90648"><div class="authors"><a href="person119.html" class="person">Laurence Halpern</a></div></a><div class="title">Time Parallelization for the Heat Equation  Based on Diagonalization</div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Fast tensor-product solvers have been proposed by Maday and Ronquist in 2007.
The parallelization in time relies on a block-diagonalization. In that process, the
choice of the time steps is crucial, as it   deteriorates both the precision and the
condition number of the linear system.  In recent works  with Martin Gander we proposed an optimization strategy for the choice of these parameters, applied to the heat equation, discretized in time with backward Euler. 
We propose here a general analysis for  the theta-method. We rely on the computation of the eigenvectors for the full discretization matrix, and very precise truncation error estimates.

We present recent progress towards constructing a parareal algorithm
for solving the rotating shallow water equations. These equations are
the simplest to exhibit behaviour relevant for atmospheric modelling
and as such are often used as a test bed for new numerical algorithms.
The parareal algorithm has two ingredients: a cheap integrator (the
coarse propagator) and a more accurate integrator (the fine
propagator). The convergence rate, and hence efficiency, of this
scheme is strongly affected by the accuracy of the coarse
propagator. Our approach follows that of [1] where it was shown that
averaging the nonlinear terms over some fast oscillations includes the
effects of near-resonances, essential for accuracy and hence
convergence. A key component of this scheme is the computation of the
exponential of the linear operator corresponding to the fast linear
waves in the system. Here we use the rational approximation approach
of [2] (REXI). This requires the solution of an elliptic problem for
each term. The REXI method is highly parallelisable as each term can
be computed separately, but the solution of each term must be
efficient, scalable and fast. In this talk, we will describe
strategies for solving the elliptic problem and present parallel
scaling results for REXI applied to a compatible finite element model
for the linear shallow water equations on the sphere.</p>

Residual neural networks (ResNets) are a type of deep neural network that exhibits excellent performance for many learning tasks, e.g., image classification and recognition. Mathematically, ResNet architectures are equivalent to a forward Euler discretization of a nonlinear initial value problem, where the time-dependent control variables are the network weights and each network layer is associated with a time-step. Thus, ResNet training can be represented as an optimal control problem of the associated dynamical system. However, both ResNet training and similar time-dependent optimal control problems from engineering applications often suffer from prohibitively long run-times because of the many sequential sweeps forwards and backwards across layers (i.e., time-steps) to carry out the optimization.  One remedy for this issue is to use parallel-in-time methods, which have shown notable improvements in scalability for some engineering applications.  This work demonstrates the use of one such parallel-in-time technique (multigrid-reduction-in-time) for the efficient and effective training of ResNets. The proposed algorithms replace the classical (sequential) forward and backward propagation through the network layers by a parallel nonlinear multigrid iteration applied to the layer domain. This adds a new dimension of parallelism across layers that is attractive when training very deep networks.  From this basic idea, we derive multiple layer-parallel methods, which allow for the simultaneous training of all network layers.  The most efficient version employs a simultaneous optimization approach based on inexact gradient information.  Using supervised classification examples, we demonstrate that our approach achieves a similar training performance to traditional methods, but enables layer-parallelism and thus provides speedup over layer-serial methods.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><a name="session:31314"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">08:00-10:05</span> <span class="title">Session 10B: Applications (Part 2 of 2)</span></div></a><div class="room"><span class="room_word">Location: </span><a href="room224.html"><span class="room_name">Bighorn B</span></a></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:00</td><td><a name="talk:90678"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person48.html">Jeffery Allen</a>, <a class="person" href="person49.html">Justin Chang</a> and <a href="person50.html" class="person">Francois Usseglio-Viretta</a></div></a><div class="title">Preconditioning Li-Ion Battery Models with Algebraic Multigrid in FEniCS</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person48.html" class="person">Jeffery Allen</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. With the increased interest in electronic vehicles, there is a focus on increasing the performance of Li-ion batteries. Two ways to increase performance are: increase the battery’s ability to charge faster or increase its charge density. Either method can be explored with the aid of highly accurate simulations.</p>
<p>A Li-ion battery contains three domains: two electrodes (anode and cathode) and the electrolyte that connects them. The geometry of these domains tend to be extremely complex. Solving the full scale system requires a fast iterative solver with an appropriate preconditioner. </p>
<p>The mathematical model describes the Lithium concentration and potential in all three domains at the microscopic scale. The transport of Lithium ions at the interface of an electrode and the electrolyte is governed by the nonlinear Butler-Volmer equation. In the electrodes, this system is very Poisson-like, and is a perfect candidate for an Algebraic Multigrid preconditioner (AMG). However, within the electrolyte, the Poisson-like system is augmented with a second-order, nonlinear, off-diagonal term that has the potential to ruin the AMG performance. The current best solution strategy is splitting the system into two blocks, one for the concentration and one for the potential. Then, perform block GMRES preconditioned with AMG. This solve is facilitated using the FEniCS and PETSc libraries.</p>
<p>The goal of this presentation is to discuss preconditioning methods for modeling Li-ion batteries. It will start by introducing the system of equations that describe the transport of Lithium Ions throughout the battery. Then, the performance of multiple solution strategies will be presented. Finally, we hope to ideas for other preconditioning strategies.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:25</td><td><a name="talk:90631"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person163.html">Fande Kong</a> and <a class="person" href="person164.html">Richard Martineau</a></div></a><div class="title">A  fully coupled, scalable eigenvalue solver with a subspace coarsening AMG preconditioner  for neutron transport equations</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person163.html" class="person">Fande Kong</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Neutron transport equations have been widely used in the study of nuclear reactor behaviors.  With the advancements  of supercomputers,  parallel simulations of the neutron transport equations become popular, but it is  a computationally  challenging task since the scalable solver is difficult to design and develop for  the neutron transport equations that is defined on a seven-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a  scalable eigenvalue solver together with a subspace coarsening AMG method for the numerical solution of neutron transport equations.  A nonlinear eigenvalue problem in the neutron transport equations is first reformed as a regular nonlinear system of equations, and then the nonlinear system is calculated using an inexact Jacobian-free Newton method. In order to speedup the simulation, an efficient preconditioner is applied during each Newton iteration for calculating  the Jacobian system of equations. In the preconditioner, a subspace coarsening algorithm is introduced to reduce the preconditioner setup time, and the resulting subspace interpolation/restriction  is extended to construct a full space AMG method for solving  the  coupled Jacobian system.

Hierarchical hybrid grids (HHG) have been proposed in conjunction with multigrid solvers to promote the efficient utilization of high performance modern computer architectures.  While HHG meshes provide some flexibility for unstructured applications, most of the multigrid calculations can be accomplished using structured grid ideas and kernels. In this paper, we generalize the HHG idea in two ways to facilitate its adoption within the unstructured finite element community. First, we introduce a mathematical framework that can address HHG meshes as well as more general types of block structured meshes. The framework illustrates the relationship between the new partially structured MG algorithms and more traditional MG algorithms, and helps provide a guide for implementing new semi-structured multigrid algorithms. Overall, our implementation focuses on significantly reducing the overall effort required by application scientists to adapt their mature finite element capabilities to an HHG solver. This is accomplished by applying a dis-assembly process to a standard finite element matrix. Second, we modify the HHG solver so that it can address significantly more complex meshes. In particular, conventional HHG meshes are constructed by uniformly refining an unstructured mesh. Instead, we consider extensions such that the underlying finest mesh can contain a few completely unstructured regions. These extensions allow finite element practitioners to use unstructured meshes in specific areas (e.g., near jagged interfaces) where they are most natural.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:50</td><td><a name="talk:90676"><div class="authors"><a href="person52.html" class="person">Eike Mueller</a>, <a class="person" href="person53.html">Peter Bastian</a>, <a href="person54.html" class="person">Steffen Muething</a> and <a href="person55.html" class="person">Marian Piatkowski</a></div></a><div class="title">Matrix-free multigrid block-smoothers for higher-order DG discretisations</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person52.html" class="person">Eike Mueller</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Due to their grid-independent convergence multigrid algorithms are popular for the solution of elliptic PDE which have been discretised with (higher-order) Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods.</p>
<p>To fully utilise computational resources, efficient and algorithmically optimal implementations are necessary. Traditionally, a given problem is solved by assembling a system of sparse equations and inverting the resulting matrix algebraically. On modern manycore chip architectures with a poor FLOP-to-bandwidth ratio this approach is very expensive with computational complexity of O(N^2) where N denotes the number of unknowns per cell. Matrix-free sum factorisation techniques in d dimensions reduce the computational complexity from O(N^2)=O(n^{2d}) to O(d*n^{d+1}), where n is the number of unknowns in one direction; this leads to significant speedups in the operator application [Muething, Bastian,Piatkowski (2017), arXiv:1711.10885].</p>
<p>In multigrid smoothers it is also necessary to invert block-diagonal matrices. Matrices D_e of size n^d*n^d are assembled in each cell e and inverted exactly. This requires O(n^{2d}) bandwidth-bound operations and quickly becomes the bottleneck of the solver as the order n increases, obliterating gains from the matrix-free operator application. To circumvent this, we solve the system D_e*x=y iteratively by implementing multiplication with D_e in a matrix-free way. This reduces the cost from O(n^{2d}) to O(n_{iter}*d*n^{d+1} where n_{iter} is the number of iterations to solve the system in each cell.</p>
<p>We solve linear convection-diffusion systems and demonstrate the algorithmic and computational efficiency of the method for a hybrid multigrid algorithm with hp-coarsening, similar to [Bastian et al. (2012), Num. Lin. Alg. with Appl. 19 (2), pp. 367-388]: on the finest level a matrix-free block smoother is applied to the high-order system, and the low-order system on the coarser levels is solved with AMG. We demonstrate the efficiency of our EXADUNE based implementation for a range of elliptic PDEs, including the SPE10 benchmark for subsurface flow.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">11:15</td><td><a name="talk:90616"><div class="authors"><a href="person187.html" class="person">Ulrich Ruede</a></div></a><div class="title">Matrix-Free Multigrid on Hierarchical Hybrid Grids</div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. For large scale computing, memory size and the cost of accessing large memory repeatedly can
easily become the dominating computational bottleneck. This is often true for efficient 
multigrid methods, which can ideally solve a partial differential equation
in only a moderate number of work units. A work unit is here understood in the sense of Achi Brandt's
textbook efficient paradigm as one application of the discretized operator.
Efficient solvers must therefore attempt to solve a given problem in as few work units as possible,
but they must also try to make a work unit itself as cheap as possible. Often the cost of a work unit can be
reduced by matrix-free techniques. Here hierachical hybrid grid (HHG) 
structures can be used to design algorithms that permit a cheap re-calculation of the nonzero
matrix elements whenever they are needed. 
The key to these techniques is to exploit locally structured sub grids in a globally unstructured mesh.
We will discuss two techniques. One method uses a scaling of
the matrix rows (aka stencils), another promising approach
uses moderate order polynomials to approximate the matrix entries. In both cases the correct stiffness matrix is
only approximated so that the corresponding error can be analyzed as a
so-called variational crime in a finite-element setting. Both techniques are useful
in massively parallel computing. Their use for large scale simulations will be demonstrated for
applications arising in geophysics.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">11:40</td><td><a name="talk:90635"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person142.html">Luc Berger-Vergiat</a>, <a href="person132.html" class="person">Ray Tuminaro</a> and <a class="person" href="person32.html">Peter Ohm</a></div></a><div class="title">Structured grid approach to accelerate multigrid on NGP</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person142.html">Luc Berger-Vergiat</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

majority of time spent in a multilevel solve--driving the performance

using a memory efficient, multilevel parallel partitioning algorithm.
In plane relaxation, 2D multilevel cycles are run on each plane.  This
results in a series of independent parallel cycles.  To improve
parallel efficiency, the uniform communication pattern of these cycles
can be exploited to aggregate communication across planes on a
process.  A straightforward application of this approach, when used
with coarse-grid redistribution at scale, is limited by the maximum
number of communicators in MPI so coordination is needed among planes.

the numerical solution of these equations are generally difficult to
solve, and require effective preconditioners to be developed. This
talk investigates monolithic multigrid preconditioners for a
one-fluid, viscoresistive MHD model in two dimensions that utilizes
a second Lagrange multiplier added to Faraday's law to enforce the
divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. We consider the
extension of a well-known relaxation scheme from the fluid dynamics
literature, Vanka relaxation, to this formulation. To isolate the
relaxation scheme from the rest of the multigrid method, we utilize inf-sup
stable elements for both constraints in the system, and a geometric multigrid
approach with finite-element interpolation operators and rediscretization for
the coarse grid construction. An additive variant of the Vanka-scheme is
discussed, and parallel numerical results are shown for the Hartmann flow
problem, a standard steady-state test problem in MHD, as well as a
time-dependent Island Coalescence problem.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:50</td><td><a name="talk:90656"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person100.html">Brian Weston</a> and <a class="person" href="person101.html">Robert Nourgaliev</a></div></a><div class="title">p-Multigrid Block Reduction Preconditioning for an All-Speed High-Order Compressible Flow Solver</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person100.html" class="person">Brian Weston</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The numerical simulation of flows associated with laser-induced phase change in metal additive manufacturing, supercritical fluids, and the slow cook-off of energetic materials present new challenges.

<p>We investigate the preconditioning for a high-order all-speed compressible Navier-Stokes solver in the ALE3D multi-physics code that addresses such challenges.

The resulting set of non-linear and linear equations are solved with a robust Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) framework.</p>
<p>In the limit of large acoustic CFL number, there is a tight coupling between the low and high order degrees of freedom, leading to a 3x3 block system per equation for a 2nd-order scheme and a 6x6 block system per equation for a 3rd-order scheme. To robustly solve the large ill-conditioned block systems, we utilize a nested Schur complement approach to reduce the NxN high-order blocks to N 1x1 blocks. The nested Schur complement preconditioner is a polynomial multigrid (p-multigrid) reduction technique, where the reduced systems can be effectively solved with an algebraic multigrid method. Numerical results are shown for the p-multigrid Schur complement preconditioned Newton-FGMRES solver in the limit of large CFL numbers for compressible internally heated convection and a supercritical flow problem.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">11:15</td><td><a name="talk:90626"><div class="authors"><a href="person101.html" class="person">Robert Nourgaliev</a></div></a><div class="title">High-Order Fully-Implicit Sharp-Interface Algorithm for Multi-fluid Contacts  </div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. A new method for high-order discretization of generally discontinuous solutions in multifluid flow simulations will be presented. The method is based on the arbitrary-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) space discretization combined with the implicit method-of-lines time discretization. We use the DG-based level set to evolve multimaterial contacts. The level set is used to accurately integrate conservation laws, accounting for presence of multiple solution fields in each "mix" computational elements, using innovative curvilinear cutcell algorithm, without any assumption of mechanical or thermal equilibrium. Combining high-order least-squares based reconstruction with interfacial jump conditions, the reconstructed solution fields allows to implement very complex interfacial physics, accurately accounting for jumps in material properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity) and surface tension without the need to add numerical diffusion to regularize the solutions. The method is demonstrated to work robustly, with the DG space discretization up to the 4th-order. The method is based on the fully-implicit Newton-Krylov solution procedure, which was essential for robustness and enabling conservation of the mixture. Numerical examples cover a wide range of applications related to laser directed energy and fluid-structure interactions.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">11:40</td><td><a name="talk:90606"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person204.html">Quan Bui</a>, <a class="person" href="person205.html">Daniel Osei-Kuffuor</a>, <a href="person206.html" class="person">Nicola Castelletto</a> and <a href="person207.html" class="person">Joshua White</a></div></a><div class="title">A scalable multigrid reduction framework for coupled multiphase poromechanics</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person204.html" class="person">Quan Bui</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Simulation of multiphase poromechanics involves solving a multi-physics problem in which multiphase flow is tightly coupled with poromechanical deformation. To capture this dynamic interplay, fully implicit methods, also known as monolithic approaches, are usually preferred. The main bottleneck of this strategy is the cost of solving the linear systems resulting from discretization of the problem. Because of the strong coupling present in the continuous problem, efficient techniques such as algebraic multigrid (AMG) cannot be directly applied to the discrete linear systems. In this work, we present our efforts in developing an algebraic framework based on multigrid reduction that is suited for tightly coupled systems of PDEs. Using this framework, the decoupling between the equations is done algebraically through defining appropriate interpolation and restriction operators. One can then employ existing solvers for each of the decoupled blocks or design a new solver based on knowledge of the physics. We will demonstrate the applicability of our framework to multiphase flow coupled with poromechanics. We show that the framework is flexible to accommodate a wide range of scenarios, as well as efficient and scalable for large problems.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">12:05</td><td><a name="talk:90642"><div class="authors"><a href="person133.html" class="person">Jack Betteridge</a>, <a href="person52.html" class="person">Eike Mueller</a>, <a class="person" href="person134.html">Ivan Graham</a>, <a href="person135.html" class="person">Thomas Gibson</a> and <a class="person" href="person136.html">Lawrence Mitchell</a></div></a><div class="title">Multigrid solvers for semi-implicit hybridised DG methods in fluid dynamics</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person133.html" class="person">Jack Betteridge</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. For problems in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), time to solution is a critical factor. Semi-implicit time-stepping methods can speed up geophysical fluid dynamics simulations by taking larger time-steps than explicit methods. This is possible because they treat the fast (but physically less important) waves implicitly, and the time-step size is not restricted by the CFL condition for these waves. One disadvantage of this method is that an expensive linear solve must be performed at every time step, however, using an effective preconditioner for an iterative method significantly reduces the computational cost of this solve, making a semi-implicit scheme faster overall.</p>
<p>Higher-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are known for having high arithmetic intensity making them well suited for modern HPC hardware, but are difficult to precondition due to the large number of coupled degrees of freedom. This coupling arises since the numerical flux introduces off diagonal artificial diffusion terms. By using a hybridised DG method we can eliminate the original coupling and instead couple the equations to a smaller global system on the trace space, which is easier to precondition. This is achieved by considering the numerical flux variables which only lie on the facets of the mesh. Recent work by Kang, Giraldo and Bui-Thanh[1] solves the resultant system directly. However, this becomes impractical for high resolution simulations. We build on this work by solving the resultant system using a non-nested geometric multigrid technique instead[2].</p>
<p>We discretise and solve the non-linear shallow water equations, an important model system in geophysical fluid dynamics, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the multigrid preconditioner for a semi-implicit IMEX time-stepper. The method is implemented in the SLATE language, which is part of the Firedrake project. Firedrake is a Python framework for solving finite element problems via code generation.</p>

An efficient hp-multigrid scheme is presented for local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) discretizations of elliptic problems, formulated around the idea of separately coarsening the underlying discrete gradient and divergence operators. We show that traditional multigrid coarsening of the primal formulation leads to poor and suboptimal multigrid performance, whereas coarsening of the flux formulation leads to optimal convergence and is equivalent to a purely geometric multigrid method. The resulting operator-coarsening schemes do not require the entire mesh hierarchy to be explicitly built, thereby obviating the need to compute quadrature rules, lifting operators, and other mesh-related quantities on coarse meshes. We show that good multigrid convergence rates are achieved in a variety of numerical tests on uniform Cartesian grids as well as for curved domains using implicitly defined meshes and for multi-phase elliptic interface problems with complex geometry.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">16:55</td><td><a name="talk:90685"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person32.html">Peter Ohm</a>, <a class="person" href="person33.html">James Adler</a> and <a href="person34.html" class="person">Xiaozhe Hu</a></div></a><div class="title">Robust solvers for a stabilized discretization of the poroelastic equations</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person32.html" class="person">Peter Ohm</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

In many models used in engineering and science, material properties are uncertain or spatially varying. For example, in geophysics, and porous media in particular, the uncertain permeability of the material is modelled as a random field. Depending on the material, these random fields can be highly anisotropic. Efficient solvers, such as the Multiple Semi-Coarsened Multigrid (MSG) method, see [11, 12, 13], are required to compute solutions for various realisations of the uncertain material. The MSG method is an extension of the classic Multigrid method that uses additional coarse grids that are coarsened in only a single coordinate direction. In this sense, it closely resembles the extension of Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC), see [4], to Multi-Index Monte Carlo (MIMC), see [7]. We present an unbiased MIMC method that reuses the MSG coarse samples, similar to the work in [9] and [16]. Our formulation of the estimator can be interpreted as the problem of learning the unknown distribution of the number of samples across all indices, and, in this sense, unifies the previous work on adaptive MIMC from [15] and unbiased estimation from [14]. We analyse the cost of this new estimator and present numerical experiments with various anisotropic random fields, where the unknown coefficients in the covariance model are considered as hyperparameters. We illustrate its robustness and superiority over standard MIMC without sample reuse.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session notalk"><a name="session:31716"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">18:15-21:00</span> <span class="title">Banquet with cash bar at Copper Conference Center</span></div></a><div class="room"><span class="room_word">Location: </span><a href="room223.html"><span class="room_name">Copper Conference Center</span></a></div></div></div>
