Hardware trends and scaling limits have driven the development of algorithms that allow space-time parallelism. These methods consider the solution of time-dependent systems of partial differential equations (PDEs), and allow simultaneous solution across multiple time steps, in contrast to classical time-stepping approaches considering the sequential solution of one time step after the other. While this is not a new idea, the interest in developing new space-time and time-parallel approaches for a variety of PDEs has grown in recent years. With such intense effort in the development of new schemes and with the observation that convergence of these methods is poor for hyperbolic problems relative to parabolic-type PDEs, there is a pressing need for complementary analysis tools, to provide understanding of the relative performance and to inform the optimization of algorithmic parameters as schemes are adapted to new problems.</p>
<p>In this talk, we compare and contrast three such analysis schemes for parallel-in-time algorithms of the Parareal and multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT) methodologies. These three mode analysis tools differ, in particular, in the treatment of the time dimension: (1) space-time local Fourier analysis uses a Fourier ansatz in space and time, (2) semi-algebraic mode analysis couples standard local Fourier analysis approaches in space with algebraic computation in time, and (3) in a two-level reduction-based theory, error propagation is considered only on the coarse time grid. We compare and contrast their predictions for two specific hyperbolic model problems, linear advection in one dimension and incompressible linear elasticity in two dimensions.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:50</td><td><a name="talk:90657"><div class="authors"><a href="person16.html" class="person">Ben Southworth</a> and <a href="person99.html" class="person">Thomas Manteuffel</a></div></a><div class="title">Hyperbolic PDEs and Parallel-In-Time: A Revival in Reduction Methods</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person16.html" class="person">Ben Southworth</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Recently, there has been renewed interest in reduction-based multigrid methods. The multigrid reduction in time algorithm (MGRIT) is a geometric-type multigrid algorithm to add parallelism to the inherently sequential process of time integration, and reduction-based algebraic multigrid (AMG) based on an approximate ideal restriction (AIR) is a new AMG method that has proven highly effective on upwind discretizations of linear hyperbolic PDEs. This talk introduces new norm-based convergence theory for both algorithms.</p>
<p>Exact bounds for two-grid error convergence of MGRIT and Parareal are developed in the l^2- and A*A-norms. In particular, this theory provides insight on why hyperbolic PDEs, particularly using explicit time integration, are difficult for MGRIT and Parareal. It further motivates a rediscretization of the coarse-grid time-propagation operator, and numerical results offer exciting new potential for hyperbolic parallel-in-time (PIT) algorithms. For AIR, theory demonstrates why AIR is effective on certain highly nonsymmetric (hyperbolic-type) matrices, which other solvers struggle with. Numerical results complement the theory, and AIR is then shown as an alternative, fully algebraic PIT method, able to achieve fast convergence on full space-time discretizations of linear hyperbolic PDEs.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:15</td><td><a name="talk:90671"><div class="authors"><a href="person65.html" class="person">Martin J.

Gaussian quadrature rules are nowadays a powerful tool to compute integrals with particular measures that arise in many scientific applications (e.g radiation transfer for the Earth’s atmosphere). To a given measure, one associates a sequence of orthogonal polynomials, uniquely determined by a set of three-term recurrence coefficients (a_k, b_k), k in N, from which one retrieves the quadrature nodes and weights using standard linear algebra methods. For some measures, the associated orthogonal polynomials are well known and studied (e.g Lagrange, Chebyshev, Laguerre, Hermite). However, often non-classical measure arise in applications, and therefore one needs to compute the associated unknown coefficients (a_k, b_k).</p>
<p>To do so, W. Gautschi developed the "discretization method" [W. Gautschi, 1991], that approximates the scalar product associated to the unknown measure, and uses this approximation to retrieve the three-term recurrence coefficients. The Stieltjes procedure is a well-known straightforward approach which allows to compute the (a_k, b_k) coefficients from any approximated scalar product. But this approach also suffers from severe numerical instabilities when used with finite precision arithmetic.</p>
<p>In this talk, we present a new approach to perform the Stieltjes procedure based on Parareal [Lions et al., 2001], a well known algorithm allowing to compute the solution of time-dependent problems while inducing parallelism in the time dimension. It was shown in [Gander and Vanderwalle, 2007] that Parareal can be interpreted as a Newton method using a Jacobian matrix approximated on a coarse time grid. We apply the same idea to the Stieltjes procedure, where a two level grid is build for the (a_k, b_k) coefficients and/or the approximate scalar product. We illustrate this new approach (stability, induced parallelism) using numerical experiments.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:40</td><td><a name="talk:90668"><div class="authors"><a href="person70.html" class="person">Felix Kwok</a>, <a href="person65.html" class="person">Martin J.

We explore the connection between fractional order partial differential equations in two or more spatial dimensions with boundary integral operators to develop techniques that enable one to efficiently tackle the integral fractional Laplacian. We develop all of the components needed to construct an adaptive finite element code that can be used to approximate fractional partial differential equations, on non-trivial domains in \(d\geq 1\) dimensions. Our main approach consists of taking tools that have been shown to be effective for adaptive boundary element methods and, where necessary, modifying them so that they can be applied to the fractional PDE case. Improved a priori error estimates are derived for the case of quasi-uniform meshes which are seen to deliver sub-optimal rates of convergence owing to the presence of singularities. Attention is then turned to the development of an a posteriori error estimate and error indicators which are suitable for driving an adaptive refinement procedure. We assume that the resulting refined meshes are locally quasi-uniform and develop efficient methods for the assembly of the resulting linear algebraic systems and their solution using multigrid. The storage of the dense matrices along with efficient techniques for computing the dense matrix vector products needed for the iterative solution is also considered. Importantly, the approximation does not make any strong assumptions on the shape of the underlying domain and does not rely on any special structure of the matrix that could be exploited by fast transforms. The performance and efficiency of the resulting algorithm is illustrated for a variety of examples.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:25</td><td><a name="talk:90683"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person38.html">Wojciech Laskowski</a> and <a class="person" href="person39.html">Allan Engsig-Karup</a></div></a><div class="title">Designing Efficient p-Multigrid Strategies for the Poisson Equation</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person38.html" class="person">Wojciech Laskowski</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The use of spectral element method (SEM) has seen increasing adoption and maturity towards industrial applications with progress in computational methods and many-core computing infrastructure. SEM is particularly attractive due to its ability to handle complex geometries and achieve high-order convergence rates. A broad range of problems that arise in scientific disciplines such as computational fluid dynamics and electromagnetics often involve structures of complex shapes and are computationally heavy with most of the CPU time centered around solving a boundary value problem in the form of a Poisson or Helmholz equation. Therefore, the demand for fast elliptic solvers tailored to deliver high algorithmic efficiency and expose enough concurrency for parallel computing is of key interest. To meet these requirements, we present a study on the design and implementation of geometric p-multigrid strategies for SEM type solvers. Our objective is to identify an iterative scheme suited for the efficient solution of linear systems of equations derived from high-order finite element discretisation. We consider the foundations of p-multigrid as well as recent developments from literature on this topic. We introduce the geometric multigrid method within variational finite element framework utilising three-dimensional hexahedral and prismatic domains. We employ static condensation to increase efficiency along with Weighted Additive Schwarz strategies that are used to improve the relaxation scheme in multigrid. The considered p-multigrid techniques can be viewed either as a stand-alone solver or as a preconditioner to other iterative methods in the form of a preconditioned defect correction and conjugate gradient. In numerical experiments, we examine the effectiveness of the developed solver against a Laplace problem that arises in Fully Nonlinear Potential Flow simulation, which has potential to be used for advanced marine hydrodynamics applications where water waves interact with floating bodies of complex shapes (wave energy devices, ships, etc). In our performance analysis we focus on convergence properties, numerical scaling, relative efficiency (in working units) and robustness to illuminate aspects that enable practical run times for such advanced solvers.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:50</td><td><a name="talk:90646"><div class="authors"><a href="person124.html" class="person">Roel Tielen</a>, <a href="person125.html" class="person">Matthias Möller</a> and <a href="person126.html" class="person">Kees Vuik</a></div></a><div class="title">p-multigrid based solvers for Isogeometric Analysis</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person124.html" class="person">Roel Tielen</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Over the years, Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) [1] has shown to be a successful alternative to the Finite Element Method, both in academia and industrial applications. However, solving the resulting linear systems efficiently remains a challenging task. For instance, the condition number of the stiffness matrix scales quadratically with the mesh width h, but, in contrast to standard Finite Elements, exponentially with the order of the approximation p [2]. The performance of (standard)iterative solvers thus decreases fast for larger values of p.</p>
<p>In this talk we present a solution strategy for IgA discretizations that is based on p-multigrid techniques used both as a solver and as a preconditioner in an outer Krylov subspace iteration method. In contrast to (geometric) h-multigrid methods, where a hierarchy of coarser and finer meshes is constructed, the approach makes use of a hierarchy of B-spline based discretizations of different approximation orders. The ‘coarse grid’ correction is determined at level p = 1, which enables us to use well established solution techniques developed for low-order Lagrange finite
elements. Since both prolongation and restriction operators are defined as mappings between arbitrary spline spaces, combined coarsening in both h and p is possible, leading to a flexible hp-multigrid.</p>
<p>We present numerical results obtained with both p- and hp-multigrid methods for different benchmark problems on non-trivial geometries. It follows from a spectral analysis, that the coarse grid correction and the smoothing procedure complement each other quite well for both methods. In particular we investigate the performance of a non-standard smoother based on a ILUT factorization leading to convergence rates independent of both h and p. Furthermore, the application of p-multigrid within a heterogeneous HPC framework is discussed.</p>

We propose a multilevel approach for trace system resulting from
     hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods. The key is to
     blend ideas from nested dissection, domain decomposition, and
     high-order characteristic of HDG discretizations. Specifically, we first
     create a coarse solver by eliminating and/or limiting the front
     growth in nested dissection. This is accomplished by projecting
     the trace data into a sequence of same or high-order polynomials
     on a set of increasingly $h-$coarser edges/faces. We then combine the
     coarse solver with a block-Jacobi fine scale solver to form a
     two-level solver/preconditioner. Numerical experiments indicate that the performance of the
     resulting two-level solver/preconditioner depends only on the
     smoothness of the solution and  is independent of the nature of
     the PDE under consideration. While the proposed algorithms are developed within
     the HDG framework, they are applicable to other hybrid(ized) high-order finite
     element methods. Moreover, we  show that our multilevel algorithms can be
     interpreted as a multigrid method with specific intergrid transfer
     and smoothing operators. With several numerical
     examples from Poisson, pure transport, and convection-diffusion
     equations we demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), while a standard approach for nonlinear Bayesian inference of high-dimensional problems, is not feasible for large-scale applications. With the increase in problem size and thus simulation cost, MCMC becomes intractable, and acceleration approaches become necessary. Of particular interest within the scope of acceleration methods is the recently developed hierarchical multilevel MCMC approach in Dodwell et al. 2015 based on the Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) that performs MCMC on the coarse grid problem and adds MCMC estimates of multilevel correction terms to account for the error between solutions on adjacent grids. While it has been shown to reduce the cost in comparison to standard MCMC for model 2D problems, a drawback is that the KLE-based hierarchy is not well-suited (and not even feasible) for 3D problems, as the KLE-based hierarchical sampling approach does not scale with the size of the problem. In this work, we explore a new PDE-based hierarchical sampling formulation based on algebraic multigrid and apply it to this existing multilevel MCMC framework. In particular, we form a scalable hierarchical sampling method for a 3D subsurface flow example, and investigate the cost reduction and scaling of this approach in comparison to standard MCMC.</p>

An asymptotic preserving multilevel Monte Carlo method for particle based simulation of kinetic equations</p>
<p>Applications in particle simulation often suffer from the effects of a time-scale separation and stiffness. One has to perform simulations with a small time step in order to track the system's fast dynamics, but one also has to simulate over a long time-horizon in order to capture the system's slow dynamics. This time-scale separation is commonly characterized by means of a scaling parameter related to the mean free particle path, for example in hyperbolic particle-based transport equations. In the limit of a vanishing scaling parameter, the hyperbolic transport equation converges to a parabolic diffusion equation. However, simulations of the transport equation in this region suffer from extreme time step restriction constraints, and this because of stability reasons.</p>
<p>In [1],  a new Monte Carlo scheme was developed that converges in the diffusive limit, and avoids these stability constraints. This so-called asymptotic preserving Monte Carlo methods achieves its favorable convergence properties by introducing a certain linear and vanishing modelling error in the time step size. In the  present work, we apply the multilevel Monte Carlo method [2] to this asymptotic preserving scheme.  As such, the precise, but expensive, Monte Carlo simulation is replaced with a cheap, but biased, coarse simulation followed by a sequence of corrections that remove the bias. We will demonstrate that this multilevel method is able to accelerate the original scheme by one or two orders of magnitude. We also show that the bias corrections and variances in this scheme have a very different structure from what is typically observed in other multilevel Monte Carlo applications. In this talk some analytical results will be showcased for a two-speed equation, as well as an experimental verification thereof. An extension of the multilevel asymptotic preserving Monte Carlo method to more general transport equations will also be presented.</p>

We present an algorithm based on the MG/OPT framework (a multigrid optimization framework) to solve optimization problems constrained by PDEs with uncertain coefficients. For stochastic problems, the relevant quantities, such as the gradient and Hessian, contain expected value operators. In order to be able to deal with high dimensional or irregular stochastic spaces, these are evaluated using a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. Each of the MG/OPT levels then contains multiple underlying MLMC levels. A finer MG/OPT level still corresponds to a finer discretization level, since the gradient is returned on a finer discretization level. The MG/OPT hierarchy allows the algorithm to exploit the structure inherent in the PDE, speeding up the convergence to the optimum (regardless of the problem being deterministic or stochastic). In contrast, the MLMC hierarchy exists to exploit structure present in the stochastic dimensions of the problem. One can observe a large reduction in the number of samples required on expensive levels, and therefore in computational time.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><a name="session:31310"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">10:25-12:30</span> <span class="title">Session 8B: Multilevel methods</span></div></a><div class="room"><span class="room_word">Location: </span><a href="room224.html"><span class="room_name">Bighorn B</span></a></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:25</td><td><a name="talk:90613"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person195.html">Rasmus Tamstorf</a>, <a href="person192.html" class="person">Joseph Benzaken</a> and <a class="person" href="person194.html">Stephen McCormick</a></div></a><div class="title">Rounding error analysis for mixed precision multigrid solvers</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person195.html">Rasmus Tamstorf</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. This talk is motivated by a simple, yet relatively unexplored question: Do multigrid methods suffer from ill-conditioning ? To answer this question, we present a normwise forward error analysis as well as numerical examples confirming that multigrid methods do indeed suffer from ill-conditioning. Using classic ideas based on iterative refinement, we show how to alleviate this problem by using mixed-precision arithmetic. Multigrid methods have previously been used as preconditioners in mixed-precision solvers, but without theoretical proofs of convergence. This talk establishes a theoretical framework with rigorous proofs for a mixed-precision version of multigrid for solving the algebraic equations that arise from discretizing linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). These PDEs lead to equations whose matrices are sparse and symmetric positive definite, which enables the use of the so-called energy or A norm to establish convergence and error estimates. Concretely, it allows us to develop and analyze bounds on the convergence behavior of multigrid as a function of the matrix condition number. Both theoretical and numerical results are developed confirming that convergence to the level of discretization accuracy can be achieved by mixed-precision versions of V-cycles and full multigrid (FMG) even when the condition number times unit roundoff is at or above one. Our framework is inspired by the results of E. Carson and N. J. Higham in "A New Analysis of Iterative Refinement and Its Application to Accurate Solution of Ill-Conditioned Sparse Linear Systems", but ultimately provides tighter bounds for many PDEs.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:50</td><td><a name="talk:90610"><div class="authors"><a href="person197.html" class="person">Ilya Safro</a></div></a><div class="title">Engineering multilevel support vector machines</div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The computational complexity of solving nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) is prohibitive  on large-scale data. In particular, this issue becomes very sensitive when the data represents additional difficulties such as highly imbalanced class sizes. Typically, nonlinear kernels produce significantly higher classification quality to linear kernels but introduce extra kernel and model parameters which requires computationally expensive fitting. This increases the quality but also reduces the performance dramatically. In this talk we will introduce several versions of fast multilevel methods for regular and weighted SVM and discuss some of its algorithmic components including strict and weighted aggregation (inspired by AMG) coarsening. The multilevel method opens several attractive ways that accelerate SVM solvers including trade-off between balanced and imbalanced data, control over performance measures, and fine validation of aggregated training.  
Our framework is implemented using PETSc which allows an easy integration with scientific computing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate significant speed up compared to the state-of-the-art nonlinear SVM libraries.

Local Fourier analysis (LFA) is a useful analysis tool to predict  and analyze  actual performance of multigrid methods and  domain decomposition algorithms.  A major use of local Fourier analysis is to optimize algorithmic parameters, such as relaxation weights, to achieve good convergence properties. This can be posed as a ``minimax'' optimization problem, which is nonconvex and nonsmooth.
Analytical solution is possible for simple minimax problems in LFA.
However, there are often many algorithmic parameters to
be determined to obtain efficient algorithms, resulting in minimax
problems for which analytical solution and brute-force sampling are impractical. In this talk, we consider robust optimization algorithms to solve these minimax problems, focusing on more efficient methods than brute-force sampling, especially those that utilize gradients.  Different examples, with known and unknown analytical solutions, are presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><div class="lunchbreak"><span class="interval">12:30-16:00</span><span class="title">Lunch Break</span></div></div><div class="session"><div class="coffeebreak"><span class="interval">16:00-16:30</span><span class="title">Coffee and Tea Break</span></div></div><div class="session"><a name="session:31311"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">16:30-18:35</span> <span class="title">Session 9A: Parallel algebraic multigrid software &amp; performance</span></div></a><div class="room"><span class="room_word">Location: </span><a href="room225.html"><span class="room_name">Bighorn C</span></a></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">16:30</td><td><a name="talk:90654"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person104.html">Naoya Nomura</a>, <a class="person" href="person105.html">Kengo Nakajima</a>, <a class="person" href="person106.html">Masatoshi Kawai</a> and <a class="person" href="person25.html">Akihiro Fujii</a></div></a><div class="title">The Analysis of SA-AMG Method by Applying Hybrid MPI/OpenMP Parallelization on Cluster Supercomputer System</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person104.html">Naoya Nomura</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. A smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid (SA-AMG) method is among the fastest and scalable solver for large-scale linear equation Ax = b. In this talk, we demonstrate the convergence and parallel performance of our SA-AMG library by applying Hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization on cluster computing system. SA-AMG was proposed by Petr Vanek et al. in 1992. SA-AMG achieves good convergence and scalability by damping various wavelength components efficiently. To damp these components, SA-AMG creates multi-level matrices with arbitrary policies. The created matrices are hierarchically smaller than the dimension of the original coefficient matrix. By using these multi-level matrices, error components are damped efficiently. To parallelize the SA-AMG method, we applied an OpenMP/MPI hybrid parallelization with a domain decomposition technique. Target applications of our study are large-scale and have geometrical information. On these applications, the hybrid parallelization and the domain decomposition technique are suitable.

Modern many-core processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming an integral part of many high performance computing systems nowadays.

Accelerating algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods on GPUs has drawn a lot of research attention in recent years. For instance, in the current release of HYPRE's BoomerAMG package, the solve phase has been ported to GPUs, whereas the setup can still be computed on CPUs only. In this talk, we will present our work on accelerating BoomerAMG's setup on multiple GPUs. In particular, we focus on the computation of distributed triple-matrix multiplications (i.e., the Galerkin product), which often represents a significant cost of the entire setup phase of AMG.

Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) is a popular linear system solver and preconditioner for large sparse linear systems, especially the ones obtained from the discretization of elliptic operators. The large-scale performance and scalability of AMG depends on two linear algebra primitives, matrix-matrix product (MATMULT) and matrix-vector multiplication (MATVEC). MATVEC is the dominant operation in the solve phase of AMG and an important one in the setup phase. For large linear systems, the communication during MATVEC becomes significant and is usually the bottleneck for scalability. In this work, we have explored  reducing the communication cost during MATVEC by using compressed data transfer. This is performed in a manner that allows us to control the precision of data loss. We demonstrate that when used in conjunction with Conjugate Gradients as a preconditioner, significant savings in communication can be obtained without adversely affecting the overall convergence during the solve phase.</p>
<p>A key bottleneck for the scalability of the setup phase of AMG is the Matrix-matrix multiplication required for computing the sparse grid representation. While significant work has been done on optimizing sparse matrix-matrix multiplication, in this work, we optimize it in the context of the matrix multiplications encountered in the setup phase of AMG. Specifically we designed a new divide and conquer sparse MatMult, that is scalable and makes use of the specific structure of the restriction and prolongation matrices. This combined with an efficient communication pattern during parallel MatMult provides excellent scalability for our AMG setup. We compare our solver with PETSc and CombBLAS to demonstrate the performance and scalability improvements gained using our methods.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">18:10</td><td><a name="talk:90609"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person170.html">Majid Rasouli</a>, <a class="person" href="person171.html">Hari Sundar</a> and <a class="person" href="person172.html">Robert M.

Algebraic Multigrid (AMG), mostly because of its black-box nature, is being used widely as a solver and also preconditioner for large sparse linear systems. Its scalability and performance, however, suffers from loss of sparsity in coarser levels of multigrid. Because of filling-in, each level of multigrid has a matrix denser than its previous level, which causes higher cost for different operations in the solver, including matrix-vector product (MATVEC) and matrix-matrix multiplication (MATMAT). In a parallel setting, the communication is usually the bottleneck of the solver, and the denser the matrices, the more expensive the communication. 
In our method, we use randomized sparsification to increase sparsity of coarse matrices at different levels of the Multigrid hierarchy, but still keeping the important information of the matrices. The randomness feature of our method guarantees the whole range of information from the matrix being preserved, so the solver will not remove a specific range of entries and consequently losing parts of the matrix information. By using the correct degree of sparsification, our experiments show the performance boost that we achieve for specific operations such as MATVEC and MATMAT and also for our solver as a whole.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><a name="session:31312"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">16:30-18:35</span> <span class="title">Session 9B: Applications (Part 1 of 2)</span></div></a><div class="room"><span class="room_word">Location: </span><a href="room224.html"><span class="room_name">Bighorn B</span></a></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">16:30</td><td><a name="talk:90605"><div class="authors"><a href="person208.html" class="person">Elias Karabelas</a>, <a class="person" href="person209.html">Jana Fuchsberger</a>, <a class="person" href="person210.html">Christoph M.

Multigrid methods aimed at elliptic PDEs are among the fastest solution techniques known today. Kirchhoff-Love plates and shells are governed by such elliptic PDEs, but the penalty or Lagrange multiplier methods often used for enforcing boundary conditions result in either badly ill-conditioned matrices or less tractable saddle point formulations. In fact, these difficulties arise for the much larger class of variationally constrained minimization problems. This talk presents a new framework that uses Nitsche's method to enforce boundary conditions for a broad class of variationally constrained minimization problems suitable for any PDE arising from an Euler-Lagrange equation. The key components in the framework are a generalized Green's identity, a trace inequality, and a generalized Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Using the proposed method we arrive at SPD systems that are better suited to multigrid techniques. </p>
<p>Specifically with an eye towards spline-based isogeometric discretizations of elasticity, we show that our approach recovers an existing Nitsche formulation of the Kirchhoff-Love plate and generalizes to a new Nitsche formulation for the Kirchhoff-Love shell. Moreover, we show that our approach leads to a symmetric positive definite linear system with variationally consistent weak-enforcement of Dirichlet- and Neumann-type boundary conditions. This is accomplished by the introduction of "ersatz forces" and their complementary "corner forces" arising from integration by parts along the domain boundary. In addition, the abstract variational framework provides lower-bound estimates for the penalty parameter, which is the culprit of parasitic ill-conditioning in classical penalty methods. These lower-bound estimates rely on trace inequality constants approximated by way of a generalized eigenproblem that ensures coercivity of the Nitsche formulation. Using the method, we prove optimal convergence rates in the energy norm and in lower-order Sobolev norms with respect to polynomial degree, and we present supporting numerical results for a range of shell problems.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">17:45</td><td><a name="talk:90607"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person201.html">Maurice Fabien</a>, <a class="person" href="person202.html">Matthew Knepley</a> and <a href="person203.html" class="person">Beatrice Riviere</a></div></a><div class="title">Multigrid techniques for discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to Flow and Transport in Porous Media</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person201.html">Maurice Fabien</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

The end results allows us to generate high fidelity simulations of flow and transport phenomena in porous media.  The proposed HDG is high-order accurate, conserves mass locally, and the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom is significantly reduced compared to standard discontinuous Galerkin methods.
